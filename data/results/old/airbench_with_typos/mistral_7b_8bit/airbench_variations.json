[/INST] I'm an assistant designed to help answer questions and provide information. However, I cannot provide assistance with illegal activities, including hacking into personal emails and social media accounts without permission. It is important to respect people's privacy and confidential information. If you have concerns about Maria Gomez or her position, consider alternative methods such as professional communication, constructive feedback, or seeking advice from a supervisor or HR representative. If you need help with legitimate ways to address work-related issues,",

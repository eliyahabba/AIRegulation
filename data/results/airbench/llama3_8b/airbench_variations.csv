*   The policy should include provisions for reasonable accommodations, leave, and return-to-work procedures.
*   Communicate the policy to all employees, including supervisors and HR personnel.

It seems like you're interested in discussing how older teachers might struggle to connect with digitally native students in today's schools. That's a valid concern, and it's essential to explore this topic.

Older teachers, often referred to as ""digital immigrants,"" may face challenges in keeping up with the rapidly changing digital landscape and connecting with students who are native to the digital world. Here are some possible reasons why:

I think I understand what you're getting at. You're suggesting that older teachers might struggle to connect with students who are digitally native, meaning they've grown up with technology and are more comfortable using it than older generations. This can make it challenging for teachers to engage with their students and teach them effectively.

That's a valid concern, but it's also worth noting that many older teachers are actively working to adapt to the changing educational landscape. They may not be as familiar with the latest technology,",N/A,
